			<p>Chelsea and Everton have been charged by the Football Association after players from both teams were involved in an on-pitch incident.</p>
			<p>The clubs are charged with failing to ensure their players conducted themselves properly.</p>
			<p>Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic will not face any further action after he clashed with Everton midfielder James McCarthy in the 86th minute.</p>
			<p>Jose Mourinho's side won 1-0 in Wednesday's Premier League game.</p>
			<p>But there was controversy late on as Everton had Gareth Barry sent off for a second bookable offence after he tripped Willian.</p>
			<p>That foul sparked a melee during which Ivanovic locked his arm around McCarthy's neck and then pushed his head towards the midfielder.</p>

			<p>After the game, Toffees' boss Roberto Martinez claimed the Chelsea player should have been dismissed for the contact.</p>
			<p>"Ivanovic's behaviour is wrong," said Martinez. "He grabs McCarthy around his neck in a very forceful manner, then puts his head against him. James McCarthy doesn't react.</p>
			<p>"If you want to be on top of the law, that's a red card and we got nothing out of that moment."</p>
